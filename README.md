# Welcome to Remix + Tamagui!

ðŸ“– See the [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs) and the [Remix Vite docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite) for details on supported features.

Note: Using `react-native` seems to cause issues with Remix. With plain Vite
we've had this working for some time, but it seems Remix has some custom
configuration that needs dealing with on the server side.

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Produciton

```sh
npm run build:production
```
